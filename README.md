# ðŸ¤– ML Algorithms Playground ðŸš€

Hey there! Welcome to my little collection of Jupyter notebooks where I mess around with different Machine Learning algorithms. Whether it's the simplicity of linear regression or the complexity of decision trees, this is where I dive deep and explore!

## ðŸ“š What's Inside?

- **Linear Regression:** Oh, the classics!
- **Logistic Regression:** Because sometimes, life is binary.
- **Decision Trees:** Branching out in all directions.
- **K Means:** It's all about that cluster life.
- ... and hopefully more to come, if I can just commit to committing files on GitHub.

If you have any cool suggestions, or just wanna chat about ML, hit me up! I'm always eager to learn and discuss.
